# Sprint-and-Retrospective

#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs, close collaboration was required betweem the product owner, team members, and stakeholders to craft and refine user stories, and ensure alignment with project goals. Creating user stories aids in this by providing a structered way to understand user requirments, motivations, and acceptance criteria, ensuring alignment between developers and users. For instance in the project I followed a structured framework that facilitated completion of user stories by evaluating complexity and prioritization during sprint planning sessions. For example, enabling users to set price limits for travel packages was prioritized to enhance user experience.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When approching program development, I break down tasks into manageable chuncks and iterate on them based on feedback. The agile process of Scrum is helpful and I hope to incorporate into my future work. It provides a framework for iterative development and emphasized collaboration, transparency, and adaptability. The use of sprints helps with breaking down the development process into managable sections.
